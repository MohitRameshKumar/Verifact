YH-KJWHKQ_0,"1. Trump - “Take a look at what I was left with. The impression that Mister Trump left me we have an economy of the regional economy collapsed. New challenge. Unemployment rate rose to 15% is terrible.” (False - While unemployment did rise significantly during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is misleading to attribute the entire state of the economy solely to Trump's actions without acknowledging the effects of the pandemic.)

2. Trump - “The only jobs he created it for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs to bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job.” (False - This statement lacks context. Job creation has occurred post-COVID, though the quality and types of jobs created can vary and are subject to debate. Claiming that only illegals benefited is not supported by comprehensive evidence.)

3. Trump - “Inflation is killing our country, it’s absolutely killing us.” (True - While inflation can significantly impact the economy and individuals’ daily lives, the extent of its impact is subjective and can be debated; however, the statement is true in that inflation rates have been a concern for many voters.)

4. Trump - “First, though, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with the decision to have done that and I will not block it.” (False - This statement is inaccurate as it misrepresents Supreme Court decisions regarding medication abortion. The legal context surrounding abortion and medication varies and is complex.)

5. Trump - “I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA. He has the worst.” (False - This claim is subjective and lacks specific data to verify approval ratings. While Trump has claimed high approval ratings, Harris' administration also has a complex record regarding veterans.)

7. Trump - “We’re very, very close to World War 3 and he’s driving us there.” (False - This claim lacks concrete evidence and context. While tensions may exist internationally, asserting we are 'very close' to World War 3 is speculative and not grounded in an agreed-upon measure of proximity to such a conflict.)

8. Trump - “You sure you continue to use an appeals court which on across the country, one single court, humid setting a new clue shed any minute.” (False - The statement appears convoluted and its meaning unclear, leading to the inability to verify its truthfulness.)"

(False - The unemployment rate reached 15% during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is misleading to attribute this solely to Trump's presidency without acknowledging the global context of the pandemic.)

2. **Speaker** - ""HE HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB. HE'S DONE A POOR JOB IN INFLATION IS KILLING OUR COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY KILLING US."" (False - While inflation was a significant issue during Biden's presidency, stating that it is ""killing our country"" is an exaggerated opinion rather than a factual assertion.)

3. **Speaker** - ""FIRST, THOUGH, THE SUPREME COURT JUST APPROVED THE ABORTION PILL. AND I AGREE WITH THE DECISION TO HAVE DONE THAT AND I WILL NOT BLOCK IT."" (True - The FDA approved mifepristone, the medication commonly used for abortion, and Biden has expressed support for protecting access to abortion medications.)

4. **Speaker** - ""I HAD THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATING FOR VETERANS TAKING CARE. THE VA. HE HAS THE WORST."" (False - Approval ratings for bipartisan support may vary, and it is not accurate to definitively claim that Trump's administration had the ""highest approval"" without specific evidence comparing the two administrations.)

6. **Speaker** - ""MY RETRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE SUCCESS. BUT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT A CONVICTED FELON, HIS SON IS A CONVICTED FELON."" (False - This is a misleading statement; while Hunter Biden has faced legal issues, referring to him as a ""convicted felon"" without stating the context of the charges and legal proceedings is misleading.)

7. **Speaker** - ""WE'RE FAILING NATION RIGHT NOW. WE'RE SERIOUSLY FAILING NATION AND WE'RE SHOWING NATION BECAUSE OF HIM AND WHICH CLOSER TO WORLD WAR 3, THEN ANYBODY CAN IMAGINE."" (False - This statement gives a subjective opinion about the state of the nation and is not supported by factual evidence to suggest the U.S. is ""closer to World War 3"" due to specific actions.)

2. Kamala Harris - ""The only jobs he created were for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs to bounce back from the COVID. He has not done a good job."" (False - While there is a debate over job creation and immigration policies, the claim that the only jobs created were for illegal immigrants is an oversimplification. Job creation statistics can vary widely based on metrics and timing.)

3. Donald Trump - ""As president, would you block abortion medication? First, though, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with the decision to have done that."" (False - The statement about the Supreme Court approving an abortion pill misrepresents the legal landscape. The Supreme Court did not rule specifically on medication abortion in a way that implies an approval of such a measure.)

4. Donald Trump - ""I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care. The VA. He has the worst."" (False - While Trump had specific positive metrics related to the VA, claims about the 'highest approval rating' need context as approval ratings can vary by polls and timing. It's difficult to definitively rank such approval statically.)

5. Kamala Harris - ""Our veterans are on the street that died because he doesn't care about our veterans."" (False - This statement generalizes the issue of veteran homelessness and care; while there are systemic issues within the VA, attributing the situation solely to one individual is misleading.)

6. Donald Trump - ""We're seriously failing nation and we're showing nation because of him and which closer to World War 3, then anybody can imagine."" (False - This statement is an oversimplification and lacks specific evidence; claims about the nation being closer to World War 3 need substantial geopolitical context to substantiate.)

7. Kamala Harris - ""The idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any manatee just because you can see he's wrong."" (False - The statement misrepresents the nature of political accountability and revenge, making it a misleading assertion.)

8. **Senator Vance - ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies."" (False)**  
   This statement incorrectly attributes the timing of the immigration crisis solely to the current administration, ignoring the complex long-standing factors that contribute to migration and border issues.

9. **Senator Vance - ""Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite, which is mass deportations."" (False)**  
   This statement misrepresents current policy. The Biden-Harris administration has not pursued mass deportation policies similar to those of the Trump administration.

10. **Governor Walz - ""Kamala Harris is providing steady leadership."" (Opinion)**  
    This statement reflects a subjective opinion and cannot be classified as true or false.

11. **Senator Vance - ""We are the cleanest economy in the entire world."" (False)**  
    This claim is misleading and cannot be deemed true; many countries have stricter environmental regulations and lower emissions levels per capita than the U.S.

12. **Senator Vance - ""Kamala Harris's policies lead to more energy production in China."" (False)**  
    This claim lacks specific evidence and oversimplifies complex trade relationships and policy impacts.

13. **Senator Vance - ""If you believe that, you'd want to resource as much American manufacturing as possible."" (Opinion)**  
    This reflects a general opinion regarding manufacturing policy and does not represent a factual statement.

14. **Senator Vance - ""People are afraid of stepping out of line Iran, which launched this attack has received over 100 billion dollars and unfrozen assets."" (False)**  
    This mixes claims about fear and financing without substantiation, misleadingly correlating two unrelated topics.

15. **Governor Walz - ""The storm could become one of the deadliest on record; more than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing."" (True)**  
    This statement reflects a commonly documented factual situation related to a specific climatic event and its casualty toll.

16. **Governor Walz - ""Donald Trump was in office when we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program."" (True)**  
    This is accurate as the JCPOA was designed to curb Iran’s nuclear activities during their administration.

17. **Senator Vance - ""Our coalition is strong and we need steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing."" (Opinion)**  
    This is a subjective claim and amounts to an opinion, which cannot be conclusively labeled as true or false.

18. **Governor Walz - ""Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China."" (True)**  
    This is true, as economic data shows significant increases in the trade deficit with China during Trump's administration.

19. **Senator Vance - ""We have 20 to 25 million illegal immigrants in the country."" (True)**  
    This estimate is widely supported by various studies and reports regarding undocumented immigrants in the United States.

20. **Governor Walz - “Climate change is real; they see 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back.” (True)**  
    This statement is accurate and corresponds with references made to increasing extremities of climate impact observed in several regions.

21. **Senator Vance - ""There is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane."" (True)**  
    Hurricane significance and the resulting loss of life can be verified with news reports around natural disasters and their impacts.

22. **Senator Vance - ""You’ve got to empower law enforcement to do their job."" (Opinion)**  
    This is an opinion and position regarding law enforcement, not a verifiable fact.

23. **Governor Walz - ""Kamala Harris’s economic plan is going to increase the nation’s deficit by 1.2 trillion dollars."" (False)**  
    This is an interpretation or estimation of future impact but cannot be outright confirmed as a fact.

24. **Senator Vance - ""Our coalition is strong and we need steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing."" (Opinion)**  
    Again, this reflects a personal opinion rather than an objective statement of fact.

In summary, when analyzing the claims made during the debate, there are various subjective statements, opinions, and some factual inaccuracies. Only the claims that can be strictly categorized as true or false are highlighted above."
