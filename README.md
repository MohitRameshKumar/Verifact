Verifact is a project my team and I created in Amadorâ€™s Advanced Computer Science for the Contemporary World class during the 2024 Presidential Debate. Our goal was to build a tool that could analyze live debate transcripts, 
recognize controversial statements, and fact-check them against credible online sources in real time.

We used the OpenAI API with the GPT-4.0 mini model and we fine-tuned our model to correct identify potentially misleading claims and provide quick verification. By the time of our presentation, Verifact achieved an accuracy 
rate of 83.7%.
